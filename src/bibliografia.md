# Open Smart Charging Protocol 1.0

OSCP 1.0 is officially released in May 2015. OCA adopted the Open Smart Charging Protocol (OSCP) a year ago. After several review rounds and an implementation version 1.0 is ready for use.

The protocol can be used to communicate a 24 hour prediction of the local available capacity to the Charge Spot Operator. The Service Provider will fit the charging profiles of the electrical vehicles within the boundaries of the available capacity.
It is a protocol between charge point management system and energy management system of the site owner or the DSO system. Therefore it is both applicable for site owners and DSOâ€™s.
