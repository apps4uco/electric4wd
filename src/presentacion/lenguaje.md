"Rust has become increasingly popular as a safer alternative to C and C++ for system development. It's become one of the most favored languages for system development. Rust is even being used now in the Linux operating system."

# C/C++



* MISRA-C++
* JSF C++

~~~
"The use of C++ for safety-critical systems is possible, provided that an appropriate coding
standard such as MISRA-C++ or JSF C++ is followed, and appropriate tools that
automatically check the conformance of all source code are used.  ...
Any programmer intending to write
safety-critical code in C++ should familiarize himself with both coding standards, as they give
a great insight into the potential hazards one has to deal with when using C++ in critical
code."
